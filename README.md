🎮 AI Pong Game with Hand Tracking 🖐️
This project is an interactive Pong game where you control the paddle using hand gestures instead of a keyboard or mouse. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the game tracks your hand movements in real-time and adjusts the paddle accordingly.

🚀 Features
✅ Hand Gesture Control – Play using your hand instead of a keyboard.
✅ AI Opponent – The game includes an AI-controlled paddle for a challenging experience.
✅ Real-Time Tracking – Uses MediaPipe Hand Tracking to detect hand position.
✅ Smooth Performance – Optimized to run at 30+ FPS using OpenCV & NumPy.
✅ Customizable Gameplay – Modify ball speed, paddle size, and AI difficulty.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV – For real-time image processing and game rendering.

MediaPipe – For accurate hand tracking.

NumPy – For efficient calculations and movement logic.

📌 How It Works
The camera detects your hand position using MediaPipe Hand Tracking.

Your index finger’s y-coordinate controls the paddle’s movement.

The AI opponent moves based on the ball’s position.

Score points by making the ball pass the opponent’s paddle!

▶️ How to Run
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
Run the game script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python pong_game.py
Move your hand up and down to control the paddle and enjoy the game!
