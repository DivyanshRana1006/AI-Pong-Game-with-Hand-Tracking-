AI Pong Game with Hand Tracking (OpenCV & MediaPipe)

Developed an interactive Pong game where players control the paddle using hand gestures detected via MediaPipe Hand Tracking. The game runs in real-time, leveraging OpenCV for rendering and NumPy for efficient calculations. An AI opponent dynamically adjusts its movement based on the ballâ€™s position, making the gameplay more challenging.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used: OpenCV, MediaPipe, Python, NumPy.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features: Hand gesture control, real-time tracking, AI opponent, smooth gameplay at 30+ FPS.
